title: "Federation Starports: From Menus to Living Spaces"

description: "We tore down the old starport menu system and rebuilt it as an immersive directory of businesses. Here's why it matters."
tags: ["features", "ui", "starports"]

**The old starports felt like a vending machine.**

Click a tab. Pick a service. Done. Functional? Sure. Immersive? Not even close.

**The new starports feel like a place you actually visit.**

When you dock now, you see a directory. Six distinct locations. Each with its own name, its own purpose, its own vibe. You're not navigating menus—you're walking through a space station.

---

## The Six Locations

### 🏦 Federation Reserve Bank
**Your credits. Secured.**

The bank does one thing: keeps your money safe when your ship goes down. Deposit credits from your wallet. Withdraw when you need them. Zero fees. Zero questions.

**Status**: ✅ Live

---

### 🔧 TriStar Shipyard & Maintenance Bay
**Repair. Rename. Upgrade.**

This is where ships get fixed and modified. Rename your vessel for 1,000 credits. Repair when you're disabled. Install warp drives. Upgrade weapons. It's all here.

**Status**: ✅ Rename and repair live | Warp/weapons/holds coming soon

---

### 🚀 Nebula Ship Sales & Acquisitions  
**Trade up. Trade in.**

Need a better ship? Nebula's got you covered. Browse available classes. Compare specs. Purchase with automatic trade-in of your current vessel. One ship per captain—make it count.

**Status**: ⏳ Coming soon

---

### 📋 Federation Contract Office
**Missions. Bounties. Credits.**

The Contract Office posts official Federation work: trade runs, patrols, recon missions. Plus NPC bounties for captains with a taste for combat. Accept contracts. Complete objectives. Get paid.

**Status**: ⏳ Coming soon

---

### 👥 Vanguard Colonial Recruitment
**Hire. Deploy. Defend.**

Planets need people. Vanguard supplies them:
- **Security personnel** (500 cr/unit) - fighters for planetary defense
- **Mining workers** (300 cr/unit) - labor for resource extraction

**Status**: ⏳ Coming soon

---

### 📦 CoreStar Tactical Supply
**Gear up.**

Tactical equipment for captains who think ahead:
- **Navigation beacons** (2,500 cr) - mark sectors for tracking
- **Proximity mines** (5,000 cr) - defensive deployables

More gear coming.

**Status**: ⏳ Coming soon

## Why This Redesign Matters

### Immersion
Each location has a name. A brand. A focus. TriStar isn't just "ship services"—it's a shipyard you visit. CoreStar isn't a menu item—it's a gear shop with a reputation.

### Organization  
Banking doesn't clutter ship services. Recruitment doesn't mix with tactical gear. Everything has its place.

### Scalability
Want to add a black market? A cantina for intel? A bounty board? Just add a new location. The system grows without breaking.
