# Combat

Prepare for hostile encounters and defend your cargo. Engage in PvP combat or fight NPCs in the dangerous sectors of space.

## PvP Combat Zones

### Safe Zones vs PvP Zones

Every sector shows a **territory badge** indicating faction and PvP status:

**Territory Badge Display:**

| Territory | PvP Disabled | PvP Enabled |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Federation | Federation Space 🛡️ | Federation Space 🛡️ |
| Pirate | Pirate Territory 🛡️ | Pirate Territory ⚔️ |
| Neutral | Neutral Space 🛡️ | Neutral Space ⚔️ |

**Icon Meaning:**
- **🛡️ Shield** - Safe zone, no PvP combat allowed
- **⚔️ Sword** - PvP zone, combat enabled

**Federation Space: Always Safe**
- Shield icon always shows
- No PvP combat allowed (ever)
- New players spawn here
- Safe retreat zone for all players
- Blue badge

**Pirate & Neutral Space: PvP When Enabled**
- Shield when galaxy PvP disabled
- Sword when galaxy PvP enabled
- Players indicator shows when others present (PvP zones only)
- Tap indicator to engage
- Red badge (Pirate), Gray badge (Neutral)

**All Ports: Safe Havens**
- Docked ships cannot attack or be attacked
- Safe to manage inventory, repair, upgrade
- Works in all sectors (Fed, Pirate, Neutral)

### Initiating PvP Combat

**Requirements:**
- Must be in PvP-enabled sector (Pirate/Neutral)
- Must have at least 1 turn

3. Tap indicator → Battle Station modal opens

6. Results shown with XP, loot, and losses

**Turn Cost:** 1 turn per attack (defender loses no turns)

### Escape & Defense

**Escape Options:**

## Combat Basics

## Combat Encounter

When combat begins:

2. **Damage calculation** - Attacker weapons vs defender shields/hull
3. **Resolution** - Winner determined by remaining health
4. **Loot** - Victor may claim cargo/credits (future)
