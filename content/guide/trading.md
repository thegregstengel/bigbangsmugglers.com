# Trading & Economy

Trading is the backbone of your career. Learn to read the markets and maximize profits.

## The Three Commodities

### 🛢️ Fuel
- **Production:** Mining stations, fuel depots, gas giants
- **Demand:** High-traffic routes, industrial centers
- **Price range:** 60-190 credits per unit

### 🌾 Organics
- **Production:** Agricultural worlds, habitable planets
- **Demand:** Space stations, urban centers
- **Price range:** 60-280 credits per unit

### ⚙️ Equipment
- **Production:** Tech hubs, industrial stations
- **Demand:** Frontier outposts, repair stations
- **Price range:** 200-1000 credits per unit

## Port Types

Different ports specialize in different goods:

| Port Type | Fuel | Organics | Equipment | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Fuel Depot** | 🟢 Cheap | 🔴 Expensive | 🟡 Normal | Best for buying fuel |
| **Agricultural** | 🔴 Expensive | 🟢 Cheap | 🔴 Expensive | Best for buying organics |
| **Tech Hub** | 🟡 Normal | 🟡 Normal | 🟢 Cheap | Best for buying equipment |
| **Trading Post** | 🟡 Normal | 🟡 Normal | 🟡 Normal | General trading |
| **Stardock** | 🟡 Normal | 🟡 Normal | 🟡 Normal | Large capacity, central hub |

## Trading Strategy

### Basic Route Trading
1. **Find a producer** - Port that sells cheap (specialty port)
2. **Find a consumer** - Port that buys expensive (opposite specialty)
3. **Calculate profit** - (Sell price - Buy price) × Cargo holds
4. **Consider distance** - Fuel costs eat into profit

### Advanced Strategy
- **Trade loops** - Buy X at Port A, sell at Port B, buy Y at Port B, sell at Port A
- **Arbitrage** - Exploit price differences between nearby ports
- **Speculation** - Buy when prices are low, wait for demand to rise (future)

## Price Mechanics

Prices fluctuate based on:
- **Supply & Demand** - More buying = higher prices
- **Port type** - Specialization affects base prices
- **Region** - Federation vs Pirate vs Unincorporated
- **Events** - Disasters, trade fairs, embargoes (future)

## Maximizing Profit

### Ship Upgrades
- **Cargo holds** - More capacity = more profit per trip
- **Warp drive** - Faster warps = more trips per hour
- **Efficiency** - Less fuel per warp (future)

### Trade Routes
1. **Short routes** - Lower profit per trip, but faster turnover
2. **Long routes** - Higher profit per trip, but slower
3. **Loops** - Trade both directions for maximum efficiency

### Market Analysis
- Check multiple ports before buying
- Compare prices in your current region
- Look for specialty ports (they have the best deals)

## Example: Profitable Run

**Starting sector:** Federation space, Port Alpha (Tech Hub)  
**Credits:** 10,000  
**Ship holds:** 50

**Step 1:** Buy at Port Alpha (Tech Hub)
- Equipment: 300 cr/unit
- Buy 33 units = 9,900 credits spent

**Step 2:** Warp to Port Beta (Frontier Outpost)
- Equipment demand high: 700 cr/unit
- Sell 33 units = 23,100 credits earned

**Profit:** 23,100 - 9,900 = **13,200 credits** (133% return)

## Tips

- Always leave credits for fuel and emergencies
- Upgrade cargo holds early for better margins
- Federation ports are safer but lower margins
- Pirate territories have better deals but higher risk
- Don't overextend - a safe profit beats a risky loss
