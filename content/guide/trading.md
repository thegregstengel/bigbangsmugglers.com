Trading is the backbone of your career. Learn to read the markets, find the spreads, and maximize your credits per turn.

## The Three Commodities

| Commodity | Price Range (buy) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Fuel | 60 to 220 cr/unit | 1 hold per unit |
| Organics | 90 to 350 cr/unit | 1 hold per unit |
| Equipment | 150 to 600 cr/unit | 2 holds per unit |

Equipment is bulky. Each unit takes 2 cargo holds, so a 40-hold ship carries only 20 units of equipment versus 40 units of fuel or organics.

## Port Types & Pricing

Different port archetypes have different price ranges and buy/sell spreads. The spread is the gap between what you pay and what you receive when selling at the same port.

| Port Type | Price Range | Spread | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Standard | Wide | 10% | General trading |
| Fuel Depot / Agri | Narrow | 6% | Specialty commodity |
| Tech Hub / Research | Wide | 15% | Equipment focus |
| Black Market | Very wide | 22% | Contraband only |
| Pirate Base | Very wide | 20% | Pirate faction |
| Federation Port | Moderate | 8% | Stable, low variance |

You make money by buying at one port and selling at another that values the commodity more highly. The spread only hurts you if you buy and sell at the same port.

## How Prices Are Calculated

Prices use a logistic curve based on the port's current stock level. When a port is fully stocked, prices are at their lowest. When a port is nearly empty, prices are at their highest. Daily price noise adds variance depending on port volatility.

**Volatility levels:**

- Low: prices barely move, stable and predictable
- Medium: normal variance
- High: significant daily swings with higher potential reward

## Buy vs Sell

Every port has a buy price (what you pay) and a sell price (what you receive). The sell price is always below the buy price at the same port. The spread percentage determines how large that gap is. A small port fee applies to all trades and is shown in the trade confirmation breakdown.

## Port Availability by Territory

Port types vary significantly by territory.

| Territory | Available Port Types |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Federation | Standard, Agri, Depot, Mining, Federation, Research |
| Neutral | Standard, Agri, Depot, Mining, Research |
| Pirate | Pirate Base and Black Market only |

You cannot buy or sell standard commodities in pirate space. Pirate sectors are for contraband and services.

## Trading Strategy

### Basic Route

1. Find a producer port that sells your commodity cheap
2. Find a consumer port that buys expensive
3. Fill your holds at the producer
4. Sell at the consumer
5. Buy something on the return leg if you can

### Maximize Profit Per Turn

More holds means more profit per trip. The Cargo Compressors tech upgrade adds 20% capacity permanently. A warp drive lets you cover longer routes in fewer turns. Federation ports are stable but lower margin. Outer rim ports have more variance but bigger swings when conditions are right.

Equipment has the highest price ceiling but costs 2 holds per unit. Run the math before committing your entire hold to equipment.

### Example Run

Ship with 40 holds, Agri port to Federation Port:

- Buy organics at Agri port for 100 cr/unit, 40 units = 4,000 cr spent
- Sell at Federation Port for 280 cr/unit, 40 units = 11,200 cr received
- Profit: 7,200 cr minus port fee of roughly 1 to 2%

With Cargo Compressors installed (48 holds): roughly 8,640 cr profit on the same route.

## Contraband Trading

Contraband from the Black Market can be sold as its underlying commodity at federation ports, with a 75% chance of confiscation if you get scanned. See the [Smuggling guide](/guide/smuggling) for the full picture.
