Tech Hub ports (labeled **Research Station**, **Market Station**, and similar research_port archetypes) offer permanent, one-time ship upgrades that make your ship more capable in specific ways.

## Where to Buy

Look for **Research Station** or **Market Station** ports on the Nav screen. These are **research_port** archetype stations: they appear in all territory types but are less common than standard trading ports.

Once in the sector, open the port and select **Tech Hub** from the services menu.

## Upgrade Catalog

All upgrades are permanent and apply immediately. Each requires a minimum XP level and credit payment. You can only purchase each upgrade once per ship.

| Upgrade | Cost | XP Required | Effect |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| Cargo Compressors | 8,000 cr | 1,000 XP | +20% max cargo capacity |
| Shield Booster Arrays | 10,000 cr | 1,500 XP | +15% max shields |
| Emergency Escape Pods | 12,000 cr | 2,000 XP | +15% escape chance |
| Combat AI Core | 15,000 cr | 3,000 XP | +20% fighter strength in combat |
| Stealth Hull Plating | 20,000 cr | 5,000 XP | -30% contraband detection risk |
| Warp Optimizer | 18,000 cr | 4,000 XP | Warp drive costs 1 fewer turn |

## How Each Upgrade Works

### Cargo Compressors
Increases your ship's cargo hold capacity by 20% of current maximum. Applied immediately: your ship gains the extra holds right away. This is a flat increase, so a 40-hold ship becomes a 48-hold ship.

### Shield Booster Arrays
Increases max shield capacity by 15% of current shields. Also tops up your current shields by the bonus amount. A 200-shield ship gains +30 shields (200 → 230). The bonus is permanent and persists through repairs.

### Emergency Escape Pods
Adds 15% to your base escape chance, capped at 95% total. Escape chance determines how likely you are to survive being disabled in combat rather than being fully destroyed.

### Combat AI Core
Stored as a flag on your ship. The combat system reads this and applies a 20% boost to your fighter effectiveness when you attack or defend. Best combined with high fighter counts from upgrades and restocking.

### Stealth Hull Plating
Stored as a flag. When the contraband scanner runs a check on your ship, this upgrade reduces the detection roll threshold by 30 percentage points. Combined with a Goods Cloaking Device (750 cr at black markets), this dramatically reduces your bust risk.

> **Stacking:** Stealth Hull Plating applies before the cloaking device check. The exact stacking formula is handled in the scanner: consult the [Smuggling guide](/guide/smuggling) for detection odds.

### Warp Optimizer
Stored as a flag. When you execute a warp, the system reads this and deducts 1 fewer turn from the warp cost. Valuable for long-range traders who warp frequently.

## Upgrade Strategy

**Early game (under 2,000 XP):**
Start with **Cargo Compressors**: more cargo means more credits per run. The XP requirement is low and it pays back quickly.

**Mid game (2,000–5,000 XP):**
**Shield Booster Arrays** if you're combat-active. **Warp Optimizer** if you're a trader covering long distances.

**Late game (5,000+ XP):**
**Stealth Hull Plating** is essential for dedicated smugglers. **Combat AI Core** for PvP-focused players.

## Notes

- Upgrades apply to your **current ship**: if you buy a new ship, upgrades do not transfer
- Each upgrade can only be purchased once per ship
- The Ship screen shows your installed upgrades so you can see what's active
