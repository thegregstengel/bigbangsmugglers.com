Tech Hub ports offer permanent, one-time ship upgrades that make your ship more capable in specific ways.

## Where to Buy

Look for Research Station or Market Station ports on the Nav screen. These are research_port archetype stations that appear in all territory types but are less common than standard trading ports.

Once in the sector, open the port and select Tech Hub from the services menu.

## Upgrade Catalog

All upgrades are permanent and apply immediately. Each requires a minimum XP level and credit payment. You can only purchase each upgrade once per ship.

| Upgrade | Cost | XP Required | Effect |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| Cargo Compressors | 8,000 cr | 1,000 XP | +20% max cargo capacity |
| Shield Booster Arrays | 10,000 cr | 1,500 XP | +15% max shields |
| Emergency Escape Pods | 12,000 cr | 2,000 XP | +15% escape chance |
| Combat AI Core | 15,000 cr | 3,000 XP | +20% fighter strength in combat |
| Stealth Hull Plating | 20,000 cr | 5,000 XP | -30% contraband detection risk |
| Warp Optimizer | 18,000 cr | 4,000 XP | Warp drive costs 1 fewer turn |

## How Each Upgrade Works

### Cargo Compressors

Increases your cargo hold capacity by 20% of current maximum, applied immediately. A 40-hold ship becomes a 48-hold ship.

### Shield Booster Arrays

Increases max shield capacity by 15% of current shields and tops up your current shields by the same amount. A 200-shield ship gains 30 shields and becomes 230. The bonus is permanent and persists through repairs.

### Emergency Escape Pods

Adds 15% to your base escape chance, capped at 95% total. Escape chance determines how likely you are to survive being disabled in NPC combat.

### Combat AI Core

Stored as a flag on your ship. The combat system reads this and applies a 20% boost to your fighter effectiveness when attacking or defending. Best combined with high fighter counts from restocking.

### Stealth Hull Plating

Stored as a flag. Reduces the detection roll threshold by 30 percentage points when customs scans your cargo. Combined with a Goods Cloaking Device (750 cr at black markets), this significantly reduces your bust risk.

### Warp Optimizer

Stored as a flag. Deducts 1 fewer turn from every warp jump. Valuable for long-range traders who warp frequently.

## Upgrade Strategy

**Early game (under 2,000 XP):** Start with Cargo Compressors. More cargo means more credits per run and the investment pays back quickly.

**Mid game (2,000 to 5,000 XP):** Shield Booster Arrays if you are combat-active. Warp Optimizer if you are covering long distances as a trader.

**Late game (5,000+ XP):** Stealth Hull Plating is essential for dedicated smugglers. Combat AI Core for PvP-focused players.

## Notes

- Upgrades apply to your current ship. If you buy a new ship, upgrades do not transfer.
- Each upgrade can only be purchased once per ship.
- The Ship screen shows your installed upgrades.
