Welcome to Big Bang Smugglers. This guide walks you through your first session: joining a galaxy, making your first trade, and getting your footing in the economy.

## Download & Sign In

1. Download Big Bang Smugglers from Google Play
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. You'll land on the main screen: no faction to choose, no character to build

You start as a **Neutral** captain. Faction alignment shifts over time based on what you do: trade in Federation space, run Federation missions, and you trend toward Federation. Smuggle contraband and fight in pirate territory, and you trend toward Pirate. It happens naturally through play.

## Join a Season

Big Bang Smugglers is played in **seasons**: time-limited galaxies that everyone competes in together. When you first open the app, you'll see a list of available seasons.

Tap **Join** on any active season to enter its galaxy.

Once you join, you'll have:
- **5,000 credits** in your wallet
- **250 turns** for the day (resets daily at midnight UTC)
- A **Frontier Scout** starter ship in Sector 0 (Federation Core)

## Your Starter Ship

Your Frontier Scout is basic but functional:

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Cargo holds | 20 |
| Shields | 15 |
| Fighters | 0 |
| Torpedoes | 0 |
| Escape chance | 30% |

It's a light exploration vessel: good for trading, not built for combat. Your first goal is to earn enough to upgrade or buy a better ship at a Starport.

## The Nav Screen

After joining, you'll be placed in **Sector 0** in Federation Core: the safest part of the galaxy. The **Nav screen** is your home base.

From Nav you can:
- See your current sector and its connections to neighboring sectors
- View points of interest: ports, planets, landmarks
- Move to adjacent sectors (costs 1 turn per move)
- Use your warp drive to jump to previously visited sectors (costs turns based on distance)

Tap a neighboring sector to move there. Each move costs 1 turn.

## Make Your First Trade

Trading is the fastest way to earn early credits.

**Step 1: Find a port**
From the Nav screen, tap a **Port** icon in your current sector or a nearby sector. Open it and look for the **Trade** option.

**Step 2: Buy low**
Check what commodities the port is selling and their current buy prices. The three commodities are:
- 🛢️ **Fuel**: cheapest, lightest (1 hold/unit)
- 🌾 **Organics**: moderate price, light (1 hold/unit)
- ⚙️ **Equipment**: most expensive, heavy (2 holds/unit)

Fill your 20 holds with whatever has the most favorable buy price. With 5,000 cr you can load up on organics or fuel without going broke.

**Step 3: Sell high**
Move to a different port type: specialty ports pay more for commodities they need. An Agricultural port sells organics cheap but pays well for fuel. A Fuel Depot is the opposite. Find the mismatch and sell for more than you paid.

**Step 4: Repeat**
Each round trip earns profit. As your credits grow, you can upgrade your cargo holds and carry more per run.

## Turns

Every action costs turns. You get **250 turns per day**, resetting at midnight UTC.

- Moving one sector: **1 turn**
- Warping (once you have a warp drive): **turns based on distance**
- Combat: **1 turn** (attacker only)
- Most port actions: **free**

When you run out of turns, you can still trade and use ports: you just can't move or fight until tomorrow's reset.

## What to Do First

Here's a simple priority order for your first session:

1. **Explore a few sectors**: open the connections from sector 0 and move outward. You need to visit sectors before you can warp to them.
2. **Find a good trade route**: try two or three ports, compare what they buy and sell, pick the best spread.
3. **Stack credits**: run that route until you can afford a ship upgrade or a new ship at a Starport.
4. **Visit a Starport**: Federation Starports offer banking, ship sales, missions, tech upgrades, and more. Find one early.
