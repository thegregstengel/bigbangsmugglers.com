# Getting Started

Welcome to Big Bang Smugglers! This guide will help you launch your career as a space trader, smuggler, or pirate.

## Creating Your Account

1. Download Big Bang Smugglers from the App Store or Google Play
2. Launch the game and create your account
3. Choose your starting faction (Federation or Pirate)

## Your First Ship

Every pilot starts with a basic ship:
- **Small cargo hold** - Room for initial trades
- **Basic shields** - Protection from minor threats
- **Starting credits** - Enough to make your first trade

## First Steps

### 1. Explore the Galaxy
- Tap the **Nav** button to see the galaxy map
- Each sector shows ports, planets, and hazards
- Tap a sector to warp there

### 2. Make Your First Trade
- Find a port with **low prices** on goods
- Buy cargo (Fuel, Organics, Equipment)
- Travel to ports with **high demand** (higher prices)
- Sell for profit!

### 3. Visit a Starport
- **Federation Starports** appear in Federation space
- **Pirate Havens** appear in Pirate territories
- Starports offer advanced services:
  - Banking
  - Ship sales
  - Upgrades
  - Missions
  - Recruitment

## Trading Basics

The economy runs on three commodities:

- 🛢️ **Fuel** - Ship power, common at mining/fuel depots
- 🌾 **Organics** - Food and supplies, common at agricultural worlds
- ⚙️ **Equipment** - Tech and parts, common at industrial stations

**Trading Strategy:**
- Buy low, sell high
- Watch for price differences between ports
- Larger holds = more profit per run
- Avoid pirate-heavy sectors unless you're ready for combat

## Next Steps

- **Upgrade your ship** - Visit starport shipyards
- **Accept missions** - Earn credits and reputation
- **Explore territories** - Federation, Pirate, or Unincorporated space
