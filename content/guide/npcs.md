The galaxy is not empty. As you move between sectors, you will encounter NPC ships. Some are pirates looking for prey. Others are traders running routes. Federation patrols enforce the law.

## How Encounters Work

Every time you move to a new sector, the game rolls for an NPC encounter. At most one NPC spawns per move. The probability depends on your current region, the NPC type, and the galaxy's base encounter rate.

## NPC Types

### Pirate Ships

The most dangerous encounter. Pirates are found throughout the galaxy but concentrate heavily in outer and deep space.

**Aggression by territory:**

- Federation space: never attacks first
- Neutral space: 33% chance of auto-attacking on spawn
- Pirate space: 66% chance of auto-attacking on spawn

**Loot from defeating pirates:** 500 to 2,000 credits plus equipment cargo. Deep space pirates drop more.

**Tiers:** Pirate ships range from tier 2 (Raider Skiff) to tier 5 (Warlord Battleship). Higher tiers appear in deeper, more dangerous regions.

### Federation Patrols

Patrol ships enforce Federation law. They do not attack players on sight. They exist to scan for contraband. When a patrol is present in a sector you move into, it scans your cargo if you are in Federation or neutral space. Carrying contraband triggers the detection roll described in the [Smuggling guide](/guide/smuggling).

Patrol ships concentrate heavily in Federation Core and Federation Space regions, with reduced presence in frontier and outer zones. They almost never appear in deep space or pirate territory.

**Tiers:** Fed Patrol Cutter (tier 2) through Star Defender (tier 5).

### Traders

Civilian merchant ships running trade routes. They never auto-aggress and carry cargo and modest credits. Traders are concentrated in core, inner, and Federation regions and are rare in pirate or deep space.

**Loot from defeating traders:** 100 to 500 credits plus mixed commodity cargo.

## Territory and Safety

| Territory | Pirate Aggression | Patrol Presence | Contraband Risk |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Federation | 0% | High | Active scanning |
| Neutral | 33% | Low | Active scanning |
| Pirate | 66% | Minimal | No scanning |

Federation space is the safest for travel but actively hostile to smugglers. Pirate space is the most dangerous for combat but completely permissive for contraband.

## NPC Combat

When an NPC auto-aggresses, combat resolves automatically using your ship's stats versus the NPC's stats. You will see the result as an encounter notification. Win and you loot credits and cargo. Lose and your ship is disabled.

NPC combat uses the same resolution system as PvP combat. Upgrade your fighters, shields, and torpedoes to handle tougher encounters in dangerous regions.
