Owning a planet is one of the most powerful moves in Big Bang Smugglers. A well-developed planet generates resources every day, gives you a private vault to store cargo, and can be fortified into a stronghold that holds off attackers. Here's everything you need to know.

---

## Claiming a Planet

When you enter a sector containing an unclaimed planet, the **Planet** tab appears on the Nav screen.

1. Navigate to the sector with the planet
2. Open the **Planet** tab
3. Tap **Claim Planet** on the Overview screen

**Cost:** 5,000 credits + 1 turn  
**Requirement:** You must be in the planet's sector to claim it

Once claimed, the planet starts producing resources on the next daily production cycle. No other player can claim it while you own it.

## Planet Storage

Your planet has its own cargo vault, separate from your ship's hold. This is useful for stockpiling goods, staging resources for trade runs, or simply keeping your ship's hold free for contraband.

### Depositing Cargo

1. Travel to your planet's sector
2. Open **Planet → Storage**
3. Choose a commodity (Fuel, Organics, or Equipment)
4. Enter a quantity and tap **Deposit**

Your ship cargo drops; planet storage goes up. Simple.

### Withdrawing Cargo

Same screen — tap **Withdraw** instead. The planet transfers goods back into your ship's hold (up to your ship's remaining capacity).

**Storage capacity** starts at 2,000 units and can be increased by upgrading your Warehouse structure.

## Garrison: Defending Your Planet

A garrison is a force of fighters stationed on your planet to defend against raids. Without a garrison, your planet is easy pickings.

### How to Garrison

First you need **Security Personnel** — trained fighters you hire at a starport:

1. Visit a Starport → **Recruitment Office** (Federation) or **Bounty Board** (Pirate)
2. Hire Security Personnel at **500 cr/unit**
3. Travel to your planet's sector
4. Open **Planet → Structures**
5. Enter a fighter count and tap **Deploy**

Hired fighters move from your personal inventory to the planet's garrison. They stay there permanently and defend the planet in combat.

**Garrison capacity** starts at 500 fighters and can be increased by upgrading the Shield structure.

> **Tip:** Garrison fighters are different from your ship's combat fighters. Ship fighters protect you in space; garrison fighters protect your planet on the ground.

## Colonizing: Boosting Production

Population directly controls how much your planet produces. A planet with zero colonists produces at 20% efficiency. A fully colonized planet produces at 100% — a 5× difference.

### How to Colonize

First you need **Mining Workers** — hired laborers from a starport:

1. Visit a Starport → **Recruitment Office** (Federation) or **Bounty Board** (Pirate)
2. Hire Mining Workers at **300 cr/unit**
3. Travel to your planet's sector
4. Open **Planet → Structures**
5. Enter a worker count and tap **Colonize**

Workers immediately settle the planet and start contributing to production. They're consumed permanently — think of it as building your colony.

**Population capacity** starts at 500 and can be increased by upgrading the Habitat structure.

---

## Daily Production

Your planet generates Fuel, Organics, and Equipment every day automatically. The amount depends on:

- **Population fill rate** — more colonists = more output
- **Factory level** — each level adds 15% to production
- **Galaxy region** — Core sectors produce more than Frontier or Deep Space

### Collecting Production

Open **Planet → Production** to see what's ready. Tap **Collect** to move it into your planet's storage. From there, you can withdraw it to your ship and trade it.

> Production accumulates whether or not you collect it — but it won't overflow your storage cap, so check in regularly.

---

## Structures

Upgrading structures improves your planet's capabilities. Each structure has 5 levels.

| Structure | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🏭 **Factory** | Boosts daily production output |
| 🏠 **Habitat** | Raises max population (colonize more workers) |
| 🏗️ **Warehouse** | Raises storage capacity |
| 🛡️ **Shield** | Raises garrison capacity (station more fighters) |

Upgrades cost credits and are purchased from **Planet → Structures**. Higher levels cost significantly more than lower ones.

## Viewing Your Personnel Inventory

Not sure how many fighters or workers you have on hand? Check **Ship → Stats** — there's a **👥 Personnel Inventory** section that shows your current fighters and workers count whenever you have any in stock.
