High-risk, high-reward. The smuggling system rewards captains willing to operate outside Federation law, but getting caught means losing your cargo and your credits.

## What Is Contraband?

Contraband is cargo purchased at Black Market ports in pirate space. Unlike standard commodities, contraband is illegal to carry in Federation and neutral space.

| Item | Price | Est. Sell Value | Risk | Cargo Weight |
|------|-------|-----------------|------|--------------|
| Stolen Equipment | 40 cr/unit | ~80 cr/unit | Medium | 2 holds/unit |
| Embargoed Organics | 30 cr/unit | ~160 cr/unit | Low | 1 hold/unit |
| Black Tech | 150 cr/unit | ~500 cr/unit | High | 2 holds/unit |

## Where to Buy Contraband

Contraband is only available at Black Market ports in pirate sectors. Regular trading ports do not exist in pirate space. Every commercial port in pirate territory is either a pirate base, black market, or service station.

To buy contraband, navigate to a pirate sector, open the port from the Nav screen, select Black Market from the port services, and purchase what you need.

## Where to Sell Contraband

Contraband sells at standard trading ports in Federation and neutral space as the underlying commodity it mimics.

- Stolen Equipment sells as equipment
- Embargoed Organics sells as organics
- Black Tech sells as equipment

The sell price reflects the underlying commodity's current price at that port.

## Detection and Confiscation

Carrying contraband into Federation or neutral space triggers enforcement. There are two detection systems.

### Federation Patrol Scans

When you move into a federation or neutral sector that has a Federation patrol NPC present, your cargo is automatically scanned.

- Base detection rate: 75%
- With a Goods Cloaking Device: 25%
- A 30-minute cooldown prevents back-to-back scans on the same player

If caught, all contraband is confiscated, a fine of 10% of estimated cargo value is deducted from your credits, and your alignment takes a -5 hit. A private feed message is sent to you.

### Port Customs Scans

When you open the trading screen at a Federation port, customs scans your hold on entry. The same detection rate and cooldown apply. The cooldown is global, so one scan of either type resets the 30-minute window.

## The Goods Cloaking Device

The most important tool for a smuggler.

- Price: 750 cr each
- Where to buy: Black Market, in the Counter-Detection Tools section
- Effect: Reduces detection rate from 75% to 25%
- Usage: Single-use, consumed automatically when a scan fires whether you are caught or not

Your current device count is shown in the black market UI. Devices stay in your inventory between sessions.

## Alignment Consequences

Getting caught degrades your alignment score by 5 points per bust. Repeated busts push you toward Pirate alignment, which opens pirate-faction benefits but closes Federation opportunities.

## Smuggling Strategy

**Low-risk run:** Carry Embargoed Organics, buy cloaking devices before crossing into fed space, and use the 30-minute cooldown window to make multiple port stops safely.

**High-profit run:** Black Tech has the best margin at roughly 3x purchase price but highest detection risk. Pair with a cloaking device and the Stealth Hull Plating tech upgrade for manageable odds.

**Route planning:** Buy contraband deep in pirate space and sell at high-demand Federation ports. Fewer sector hops through fed space means fewer scan opportunities.
