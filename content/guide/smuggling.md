High-risk, high-reward. The smuggling system rewards bold captains willing to operate outside Federation law — but getting caught means losing your cargo and your credits.

## What Is Contraband?

Contraband is cargo purchased at **Black Market** ports in pirate space. Unlike standard commodities (fuel, organics, equipment), contraband is illegal to carry in Federation-controlled and neutral space.

There are four types available:

| Item | Price | Est. Sell Value | Risk | Cargo Weight |
|------|-------|-----------------|------|--------------|
| Stolen Equipment | 40 cr/unit | ~80 cr/unit | Medium | 2 holds/unit |
| Embargoed Organics | 30 cr/unit | ~160 cr/unit | Low | 1 hold/unit |
| Black Tech | 150 cr/unit | ~500 cr/unit | High | 2 holds/unit |

> **Note:** Equipment-type contraband (Stolen Equipment, Black Tech) uses **2 cargo holds per unit** — same as regular equipment.

## Where to Buy Contraband

Contraband is only available at **Black Market** ports, which only appear in **pirate sectors**. Regular trading ports do not exist in pirate space — every port with trade goods in pirate territory is either a pirate base, black market, or repair/service station.

To access the black market:
1. Navigate to a pirate sector
2. Open the port from the Nav screen
3. Select **Black Market** from the port services
4. Purchase your contraband — no questions asked

## Where to Sell Contraband

Contraband sells at **standard trading ports** in Federation and neutral space. Because contraband has no official buy price at ports, it sells as the underlying commodity it mimics:

- Stolen Equipment → sells as equipment
- Embargoed Organics → sells as organics
- Black Tech → sells as equipment

The sell price reflects the underlying commodity's current port price at that location.

## The Risk: Detection & Confiscation

Carrying contraband into Federation or neutral space triggers customs enforcement. There are two detection systems:

### Federation Patrol Scans (On Movement)

When you move into a **federation or neutral sector** that has a Federation patrol NPC present, your cargo is automatically scanned.

- **Base detection rate: 75%** (3 in 4 chance of being caught)
- **With Goods Cloaking Device: 25%** (1 in 4 chance)
- A 30-minute cooldown prevents back-to-back scans on the same player

**If caught:**
- All contraband cargo is confiscated
- Fine: 10% of estimated cargo value deducted from credits
- Alignment penalty: -5 alignment score
- Private feed message sent to you

### Port Customs Scans (On Docking)

When you **open the trading screen at a Federation port**, customs scans your hold on entry.

- Same detection rate: **75%** base / **25%** with cloaking device
- Same 30-minute global cooldown shared with patrol scans
- Same consequences: confiscation + fine + alignment hit

> The cooldown is **global** — one scan (patrol or port) resets the 30-minute window regardless of which triggered it.

## The Goods Cloaking Device

The single most important tool for a smuggler.

- **Price:** 750 cr each
- **Where to buy:** Black Market (Counter-Detection Tools section)
- **Effect:** Reduces detection rate from 75% to 25%
- **Usage:** Single-use — consumed automatically when a scan fires, whether you're caught or not
- **Stack:** Works with Stealth Hull Plating tech upgrade for further reductions

Your current device count is shown in the black market UI. Devices are stored in your inventory.

## Alignment Consequences

Getting caught degrades your **alignment score** by 5 points per bust. Alignment affects faction reputation with the Federation, access to certain missions, and how NPCs treat you in different territories. Repeated busts push you toward Pirate alignment.

## Smuggling Strategy

**Low-risk run:** Carry Embargoed Organics (low risk), buy cloaking devices before crossing into fed space, use the 30-minute cooldown window to make multiple port stops safely.

**High-profit run:** Black Tech has the best margin (~3x purchase price) but highest detection risk. Pair with a cloaking device and Stealth Hull Plating tech upgrade.

**Route planning:** Buy contraband deep in pirate space, sell at high-demand Federation ports. Fewer sector hops in fed space means fewer scan opportunities.
