Two deployable tools give you persistent presence in the galaxy beyond your ship. Navigation Beacons mark sectors you have explored. Proximity Mines defend planets you own.

## Getting Inventory

Both items are purchased at Starports in the Supply or Equipment section.

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Navigation Beacon | 2,500 cr each |
| Proximity Mine | 5,000 cr each |

You must have items in your inventory before you can deploy them. The Ship screen shows your current beacon and mine counts.

## Navigation Beacons

Beacons are persistent markers you place in sectors you have visited. They appear on your Nav card and let you track explored territory and important locations across the galaxy.

### Deploying a Beacon

1. Navigate to the sector you want to mark
2. Open the Ship screen and go to the Actions tab
3. Tap Deploy Beacon
4. Give it a name, up to 15 characters
5. Confirm to place it

Deploying costs 1 beacon from inventory and does not cost a turn.

**Limits:** Maximum 5 beacons per galaxy at any time, and only one beacon per sector.

### Viewing Your Beacons

Deployed beacons appear in the Beacons section of the Nav screen and are visible from any sector. Each beacon shows your given name, the sector number, territory type, and points of interest count.

### Removing Your Own Beacon

Tap Remove on any of your beacons in the Beacons section. Removing your own beacon is free and takes effect immediately.

### Destroying Other Players' Beacons

If you are in the same sector as another player's beacon, you will see it listed under Foreign beacons in this sector. Destroying it costs 1 turn. The beacon is deleted and the owner receives a feed notification.

## Proximity Mines

Mines are defensive deployables placed in sectors where you own a planet. They trigger automatically when hostile ships enter the sector.

### Deploying a Mine

1. Navigate to a sector where you own a planet
2. Open the Ship screen and go to the Actions tab
3. Tap Deploy Mine
4. Confirm to place it

You must own a planet in the sector and have at least 1 mine in inventory.

### How Mines Trigger

Proximity mines arm automatically when deployed. When a ship enters the sector, the mine evaluates threat level and fires if triggered. It deals damage to the entering ship's fighters and shields and is consumed on detonation.

### Mine Strategy

Mines work best on colonized planets with structures worth defending. They act as a first line of defense before your garrison fighters engage. Check your planet sector after combat events and redeploy as needed.

## Inventory Management

Your beacon and mine counts are visible on the Ship screen. Track them before long expeditions. You cannot deploy what you do not have, and there is no way to recover a deployed beacon except by removing it manually.
