Two deployable tools give you persistent presence in the galaxy beyond your ship: **Navigation Beacons** mark sectors you've explored, and **Proximity Mines** defend planets you own.

## Getting Inventory

Both items are purchased at Starports under the **Supply** or **Equipment** section:

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Navigation Beacon | 2,500 cr each |
| Proximity Mine | 5,000 cr each |

You must have items in your inventory before you can deploy them. The Ship screen shows your current beacon and mine counts.

## Navigation Beacons

Beacons are persistent markers you place in sectors you've visited. They appear on your Nav card as long as they exist, letting you track explored territory and important sectors across the galaxy.

### Deploying a Beacon

1. Navigate to the sector you want to mark
2. Open the **Ship screen → Actions tab**
3. Tap **Deploy Beacon**
4. Give it a name (max 15 characters)
5. Confirm: beacon is placed, inventory decremented

**Limits:**
- Maximum **5 beacons** per galaxy at any time
- One beacon per sector (you can't stack two in the same sector)
- Deploying costs 1 beacon from inventory; placement is free (no turn cost)

### Viewing Your Beacons

Deployed beacons appear in the **Nav screen's Beacons section**, visible from any sector. Each beacon shows:
- Your given name
- Sector number
- Territory type
- Points of interest count

You can see them from anywhere in the galaxy: no need to be in the sector.

### Removing Your Own Beacon

From the Beacons section in the Nav screen, tap **Remove** on any of your beacons. Removing your own beacon is **free** (no turn cost) and removes it from the sector immediately.

### Destroying Other Players' Beacons

If you're in the same sector as another player's beacon, you'll see it listed under **Foreign beacons in this sector**. You can destroy it:

- **Cost:** 1 turn
- **Effect:** Beacon deleted, feed message sent to the owner

This is useful for eliminating rival player tracking in contested sectors.

## Proximity Mines

Mines are defensive deployables placed in sectors where you own a planet. They trigger automatically when hostile ships enter the sector, dealing damage or disabling them.

### Deploying a Mine

1. Navigate to a sector where you **own a planet** (mines require planetary ownership)
2. Open the **Ship screen → Actions tab**
3. Tap **Deploy Mine**
4. Confirm: mine is placed, inventory decremented

**Requirements:**
- You must own a planet in the sector
- You must have at least 1 mine in inventory

**Limits:** There is no hard cap on mines per sector, but each mine costs 5,000 credits: they're an investment.

### How Mines Trigger

Proximity mines arm automatically when deployed. When a ship enters the sector:
- The mine evaluates threat level
- If triggered, it fires: dealing damage to the entering ship's fighters and shields
- The mine is consumed on detonation

Mines don't discriminate: they protect your planet from any hostile incursion.

### Mine Strategy

- **Protect high-value planets:** Mines are best on colonized planets with structures (warehouses, factories) worth defending
- **Layer with garrison:** Mines act as a first line before garrison fighters engage
- **Restock after triggers:** Check your planet sector after combat events and redeploy if needed

## Inventory Management

Your beacon and mine counts are visible on the Ship screen. Track them before long expeditions into unknown space: you can't deploy what you don't have, and there's no way to recover a deployed beacon except by removing it manually.
