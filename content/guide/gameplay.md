# Gameplay Basics

Master the fundamentals of Big Bang Smugglers.

## Navigation

### The Galaxy Map
- **Sectors** - Each sector is a location you can warp to
- **Links** - Lines between sectors show warp routes
- **Territories** - Federation (blue), Pirate (red), Unincorporated (gray)
- **Current location** - Highlighted sector

### Moving Around
1. Open the Nav screen
2. Tap a connected sector
3. Confirm warp (uses fuel)
4. Arrive at destination

**Warp Drive Levels:**
- Level 0: No warp drive (must install at starport)
- Level 1-5: Faster warps, longer range

## Your Ship

### Ship Stats
- **Shields** - Protection from damage
- **Hull** - Structural integrity (if shields fail)
- **Fighters** - Defensive craft for combat
- **Torpedoes** - Offensive weapons
- **Cargo Holds** - How much you can carry

### Ship Types
Ships come in different classes with different strengths:
- **Trading ships** - Maximum cargo, light weapons
- **War ships** - Heavy weapons, moderate cargo
- **Balanced ships** - Middle ground

### Maintenance
- **Repair** at ports or starports
- **Restock** torpedoes and fighters
- **Refuel** at any port

## Credits & Economy

Credits are the universal currency. Earn them through:
- **Trading** - Buy low, sell high
- **Missions** - Complete objectives
- **Salvage** - Collect from destroyed ships (future)
- **Piracy** - Attack other ships (future)

Spend credits on:
- **Cargo** - Trade goods
- **Ships** - Buy better vessels at starports
- **Upgrades** - Improve your ship's capabilities
- **Services** - Repairs, refueling, recruitment

## Banking

Store credits safely at starport banks:
- **Deposit** - Store credits (safe from loss)
- **Withdraw** - Take credits back into ship's account
- **Interest** - Earn passive income (future)

## Factions

### Federation Space
- **Law & Order** - Safer, regulated trade
- **Federation Starports** - Corporate names, clean facilities
- **Higher prices** - But safer routes

### Pirate Territories
- **Wild West** - Dangerous but profitable
- **Pirate Havens** - Criminal names, rough facilities
- **Lower prices** - Risk vs reward

### Unincorporated Space
- **No Man's Land** - Independent ports
- **Varied** - Safety and prices vary by location

## Tips

- Always keep enough credits for fuel and repairs
- Store excess credits in starport banks
- Upgrade your ship gradually - don't overextend
- Federation space is safer for new pilots
- Pirate space has better margins for experienced traders
