Missions give you objectives beyond free trading: structured tasks that pay credits, XP, and faction reputation. They're available in most galaxies and refresh periodically.

## Finding Missions

Missions are listed in the **Mission Board** at any Starport. The board shows available missions for your current galaxy, filtered by your faction access.

Your faction determines which mission types you can see:
- **Federation-aligned:** Access to Courier and Patrol missions
- **Pirate-aligned:** Access to Smuggle, Raid, and Bounty missions
- **Neutral:** Access to Courier and Patrol missions

## Mission Types

| Type | Faction | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Courier | Federation / Neutral | Deliver cargo between sectors |
| Patrol | Federation / Neutral | Clear NPCs from designated sectors |
| Escort | Any | Protect a convoy through hostile space |
| Bounty | Pirate | Hunt a specific NPC or player target |
| Trade | Any | Execute trades at specified ports |
| Smuggle | Pirate | Move contraband past enforcement |
| Raid | Pirate | Attack and loot specified targets |
| Recon | Any | Scout sectors and gather intelligence |
| Resource Extraction | Any | Mine or harvest resources from planets |

## Difficulty Tiers

Missions come in four difficulty tiers that scale rewards and requirements:

| Tier | Label | Reward Scale |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Easy | Base |
| 2 | Medium | ~2× |
| 3 | Hard | ~4× |
| 4 | Elite | ~8× |

Higher-tier missions may require minimum reputation with the issuing faction, minimum alignment score, or a specific ship class.

## Accepting a Mission

1. Open the Mission Board at any Starport
2. Browse available missions: each shows type, difficulty, objectives, and rewards
3. Tap **Accept** on any mission that interests you
4. The mission moves to your Active Missions list on the Ship screen

You can have multiple missions active simultaneously.

## Completing Objectives

Mission progress tracks automatically as you play. Common objective types:

- **Travel to a sector**: just move there while the mission is active
- **Defeat NPC ships**: combat victories in the right sector
- **Trade at a port**: buy or sell at the specified location
- **Claim or upgrade a planet**: planetary development actions
- **Return to origin**: bring goods or proof back to the mission source

The Ship screen shows your active missions with a progress indicator per objective.

## Collecting Rewards

When all objectives are complete, return to any Starport and tap **Complete Mission** from your active missions list (or it may auto-complete).

**Rewards per mission:**
- Credits (deposited directly to your wallet)
- XP (contributes to your level progression)
- Faction reputation (Federation, Pirate, or Neutral standing)
- Alignment adjustment (positive or negative)

## Mission Expiry

Missions have expiry timers. If you don't complete a mission before it expires, it fails: you lose access to the objectives but keep anything you earned along the way.

Check expiry times before accepting long or complex missions. A hard mission with a 1-hour timer is a different commitment than the same mission with a 24-hour window.

## Tips

- **Stack compatible missions:** Two courier missions going in the same direction cost the same turns as one
- **Patrol missions and NPC farming:** Patrol objectives align naturally with clearing dangerous sectors: you'd fight those NPCs anyway
- **Smuggle missions for smugglers:** If you're already running contraband, pick up a smuggle mission going the same direction for bonus credit on top of your trade profit
- **Check requirements first:** Elite missions may require faction reputation you haven't built yet: accept them too early and you'll fail immediately
