Missions give you structured objectives beyond free trading. They pay credits, XP, and faction reputation and are available at most starports throughout the galaxy.

## Finding Missions

Missions are listed on the Mission Board at any Starport. The board shows available missions for your current galaxy, filtered by your faction access.

- Federation-aligned players access Courier and Patrol missions
- Pirate-aligned players access Smuggle, Raid, and Bounty missions
- Neutral players access Courier and Patrol missions

## Mission Types

| Type | Faction | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Courier | Federation / Neutral | Deliver cargo between sectors |
| Patrol | Federation / Neutral | Clear NPCs from designated sectors |
| Escort | Any | Protect a convoy through hostile space |
| Bounty | Pirate | Hunt a specific NPC or player target |
| Trade | Any | Execute trades at specified ports |
| Smuggle | Pirate | Move contraband past enforcement |
| Raid | Pirate | Attack and loot specified targets |
| Recon | Any | Scout sectors and gather intelligence |
| Resource Extraction | Any | Mine or harvest resources from planets |

## Difficulty Tiers

Missions come in four difficulty tiers that scale rewards and requirements.

| Tier | Label | Reward Scale |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Easy | Base |
| 2 | Medium | ~2x |
| 3 | Hard | ~4x |
| 4 | Elite | ~8x |

Higher-tier missions may require minimum faction reputation, a minimum alignment score, or a specific ship class.

## Accepting a Mission

Open the Mission Board at any Starport, browse available missions, and tap Accept on any mission you want. The mission moves to your Active Missions list on the Ship screen. You can have multiple missions active simultaneously.

## Completing Objectives

Mission progress tracks automatically as you play. Common objective types include traveling to a specific sector, defeating NPC ships, trading at a port, claiming or upgrading a planet, and returning to the mission origin.

The Ship screen shows your active missions with a progress indicator per objective.

## Collecting Rewards

When all objectives are complete, return to any Starport and complete the mission from your active missions list. Rewards include credits deposited directly to your wallet, XP toward your level, faction reputation, and alignment adjustment.

## Mission Expiry

Missions have expiry timers. If you do not complete a mission before it expires, it fails. Check expiry times before accepting long or complex missions.

## Tips

- Stack compatible missions. Two courier missions going in the same direction cost the same turns as one.
- Patrol objectives align naturally with clearing dangerous sectors. You would fight those NPCs anyway.
- If you are already running contraband, pick up a smuggle mission going the same direction for bonus credits on top of your trade profit.
- Check requirements before accepting elite missions. You may fail immediately if you do not meet faction reputation thresholds.
