The bounty system lets any player put a price on another captain's head. Post the reward at your Starport's Wanted Postings board, and anyone who defeats that player in PvP automatically collects the payout.

## Posting a Bounty

Go to your Starport and open the Wanted Postings (or Bounty Hunter Registry in pirate ports). Select a target player by their ID, set the bounty amount, and confirm.

**Rules:**

- Minimum bounty: 500 cr
- Maximum bounty per posting: 100,000 cr
- Posting fee: 10% of the bounty amount, charged upfront and non-refundable
- You cannot post a bounty on yourself
- You can only have one active bounty on a given player at a time
- Bounties expire after 7 days if uncollected

The total cost to post a 10,000 cr bounty is 11,000 cr (10,000 cr reward plus 1,000 cr posting fee). The fee is burned regardless of outcome.

## Collecting a Bounty

Bounties collect automatically. When a player wins a PvP fight against a target who has active bounties on them, all matching bounties on that target are collected immediately and the credits go to the winner's bank. The payout appears in the combat recap screen under the outcome section.

You cannot collect a bounty you personally posted by defeating the target yourself. That prevents gaming the system by posting on an alt account.

## The Bounty Board

The Wanted Postings board at your Starport shows all active bounties in the galaxy sorted by size. You can see:

- Bounties you have posted
- Bounties currently on your own head, with a total displayed prominently
- All other active bounties with time remaining

If you have bounties on your head, a WANTED banner shows your total exposure. This is intentional public information and a signal to potential hunters.

## Strategic Uses

**As a planet owner:** When a pirate robs your Trading Post the feed announces their name galaxy-wide. That is a natural moment to post a bounty. The galaxy saw what they did and any hunter can collect your reward.

**As a hunter:** Sort the bounty board by amount and look for targets in sectors you can reach. A large bounty on a well-known pirate can be more profitable than a trade run.

**As a target:** There is no mechanic to remove a bounty once posted. The only ways out are to get disabled by the hunter (bounty collected and done), wait for the 7-day expiry, or avoid being in PvP-enabled sectors.
