Big Bang Smugglers is played in seasons. Each season is a time-limited campaign in a fresh galaxy where players compete together. When a season ends, standings are recorded, the galaxy closes, and a new one opens.

## How Seasons Work

Each season takes place in a newly generated galaxy. Everything resets between seasons. Sectors, ports, planets, NPC positions, and trade prices all start fresh. You carry nothing in from a previous season.

**Season lifecycle:**

1. An admin creates a new galaxy. A feed message announces the Big Bang to all players.
2. Players join and the galaxy becomes fully active.
3. A season ending feed notification fires when the end date is approaching.
4. The season closes, winners are recorded, and the galaxy locks.
5. Final standings are written to season history.

The default season length is 30 days.

## Joining a Season

When a new season opens, you will see it in the Leaderboard or Season screen. Tap Join to enter the galaxy. You can participate in multiple concurrent seasons if the server is running more than one.

## Scoring and Leaderboard

The leaderboard ranks players by XP earned during the season. When two players are tied on XP, total credits earned breaks the tie.

**How to earn XP:**

- Trading (buy and sell transactions)
- Completing missions
- Winning combat
- Claiming and developing planets
- Exploring new sectors

The Leaderboard screen shows your current rank in the active season, top players and their scores, and an overall all-time leaderboard across all seasons.

## Season End

When a season ends, your standing is locked, the galaxy closes and you are removed from it, your ship and assets reset for the next season, and your final rank is saved to your permanent season history.

The feed notifies you before the close, giving you time to finish trades, collect planet production, and make your final moves.

## New Season Strategy

Since every season is a fresh start, early decisions matter.

1. Explore fast. Sectors you have not visited cannot be warped to. Cover ground early to build your warp network.
2. Find the trade routes. Price bands are randomized per galaxy. Scout ports before committing to a route.
3. Claim a planet early. Planets compound over time. Claiming and developing one in the first few days pays off for the rest of the season.
4. Stack missions alongside trading. Missions give early XP boosts and often align with routes you are already running.

## Season Records

Your final standings from each season are stored permanently. Over time this builds a career record across the galaxy's lifetimes.
